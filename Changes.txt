    * tune.s3ql now has a --copy option to copy buckets
    
    * Storage location for new buckets can be specified in mkfs.s3ql and 
      tune.s3ql with --s3-location
      
    * Fixed a deadlock in mount.s3ql when using local buckets without --fg
    
    * The local: bucket specifier is no longer artificially slow.

    * mount.s3ql: --allow_other is now working

    * Fixed a deadlock that caused umount.s3ql to hang indefinitely when
      mount was called without --fg
      
    * The '.' and '..' directory entries are no longer explicitly stored
      in the database.
       
    * Rewrote the mechanism to handle delayed updates. Now it no longer depends
      on a small object being propagated relatively fast, but is able to handle
      arbitrary network outages.
