    * Fixed a deadlock that caused umount.s3ql to hang indefinitely when
      mount was called without --fg
      
    * The '.' and '..' directory entries are no longer explicitly stored
      in the database.
       
    * Rewrote the mechanism to handle delayed updates. Now it no longer depends
      on a small object being propagated relatively fast, but is able to handle
      arbitrary network outages.
