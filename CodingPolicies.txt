Logging
=======

The ERROR log level should be used if something went wrong
in the code. Usually, an error log message indicates a bug
that should be fixed.


The WARN log level should be used if the *user* requested
something impossible or most likely undesired from the
program. A warning message does not mean that anything is
wrong in the program code.
