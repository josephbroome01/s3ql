About S3QL
----------

S3QL mounts an Amazon S3 bucket as a filesystem. This allows you to store data
on Amazon S3 as if it were on a local harddisk with infinite capacity. If
desired, the data can also be stored on S3 in compressed and encrypted form.

S3QL was created for usage with storeBackup in order to implement a powerful
backup solution using Amazon S3 as a backend. It has also been designed with
Amazon's new S3 pricing model in bind and tries to minimize the number of HTTP
requests.

S3QL has been written and is maintained by Nikolaus Rath <Nikolaus@rath.org>.
