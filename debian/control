Description: a full-featured file system for online data storage
 S3QL is a file system that stores all its data online. It supports
 online storage services like Amazon S3 as well as arbitrary FTP or
 SFTP servers. It effectively provides you with a hard disk of
 infinite capacity that can be accessed from any computer with
 internet access.
 .
 S3QL has been designed mainly for backup and archival purposes and
 many of its features are especially geared towards this. However,
 since S3QL is providing a standard UNIX file system, it can in
 principle be used for any other application as well.
 .
 S3QL is designed to favor simplicity and elegance over performance
 and feature-richness. Care has been taken to make the source code as
 readable and serviceable as possible. Solid error detection and error
 handling have been included from the very first line, and S3QL comes
 with extensive automated test cases for all its components.
