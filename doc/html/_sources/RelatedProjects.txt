If S3QL does not suit your needs, you might be interested in one of the following projects. Note that more information about several of the other S3 file systems is compiled in the [comparison Comparison of S3QL to other S3 File Systems].

== S3 File Systems ==
  
Note that there are several projects named _s3fs_.

 * [https://fedorahosted.org/s3fs/ s3fs] 

 * [http://code.google.com/p/s3fs s3fs]; this one is a free version of [http://www.subcloud.com/ SubCloud], a commercial S3 file system. 

 * [http://code.google.com/p/s3backer S3backer] exposes S3 as a virtual block device. You can use it with any filesystem you want.

 * [http://www.persistentfs.com/ PersistentFS] is another commercial S3 filesystem. It is however, still in Alpha stage and free for use until the first release is available.

 * [http://www.elasticdrive.com/ ElasticDrive]; another commercial product

 * [http://code.google.com/p/s3fs-fuse/ s3fs-fuse]; seems to be dead

 * [http://www.jungledisk.com/ JungleDisk]; the oldest of the s3 file systems. Commercial.

 * With [http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/ EBS] one can access S3 buckets as block-devices on [http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ EC2] instances. Since the block device exists "within AWS" on the EC2 instance,  this circumvents many principal problems that [http://code.google.com/p/s3backer S3backer] faces. From the EC2 instance, a created filesystem can then be exported using any network filesystem (e.g. [http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html sshfs]). 

== Online Backup Programs ==

 * [http://code.google.com/p/quillen Quillen] is a snapshot-based backup program that stores its data directly in S3. 

 * [https://spideroak.com/ SpiderOak] is a commercial online backup solution with reasonable prices also for individuals. It supports encryption and de-duplication and saves the data in a S3-like cloud. Although the concept seems very promising, the  software repeatedly suffered from critical bugs, the service has been plagued by outages and the support is usually responsive but rarely able to correct the problems. Not recommended at this point in time.

Finally, [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/storebackup storeBackup] is a snapshot based backup program that uses hardlinks to avoid data-duplication. S3QL has originally been designed for use with storeBackup.
