#summary Comparison to other S3 file systems

= Comparison to other S3 File Systems =

There are quite a number of S3 file systems around. The following table attempts to give an overview. Obviously, it is biased in favor of S3QL, because it mainly lists the reasons why the author chose to write a new file system instead of using one of the existing ones.

Please don't hesitate to submit any corrections or additions, I hope that this table will become less biased over time.

Some more S3 file systems are also listed under [RelatedProjects Related Projects].
