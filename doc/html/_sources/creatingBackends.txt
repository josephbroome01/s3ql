#summary Creating new Backends

= Creating new Backends =

Implementing a new backend for S3QL is a relatively easy task. A backend only has to provide the following functions:

 # Store an object
 # Fetch an object
 # List available objects
 # Delete an object
 # Copy an object

The best way to start is to look at [http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/source/browse/trunk/src/s3ql/backends/local.py s3ql/backends/local.py]. The code should be pretty self explanatory.
