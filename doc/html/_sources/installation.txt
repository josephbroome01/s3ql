 Installation
==============


 * Under Linux, make sure that you are using at least kernel 2.6.26.


Installing Dependencies
=======================

Debian / Ubuntu
---------------

If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, most of the prerequisites are already
packaged, so the following command should take care of all
dependencies::

  aptitude install python-dev libfuse2 libfuse-dev \
                   gccxml python-pycryptopp libattr1-dev liblzma-dev liblzma0


After that, you need to manually install the `Python APSW module
<http://code.google.com/p/apsw/>`_ (since the version required by S3QL
is not yet available as a package).

#. Download the source from http://code.google.com/p/apsw/downloads/list
#. Extract the zip file into a temporary folder of your choice
#. Inside that folder, run `python setup.py fetch --sqlite build`
#. Still in the same folder, run `python setup.py install --user`


CentOS 5
--------

Under CentOS 5, you can install the required packages with the following commands:
(thanks to `heri16 <http://code.google.com/u/heri16/>`_)::

  yum install libattr-devel fuse-libs fuse-devel fuse gcc-c++ bzip2 unzip

  wget http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
  yum --nogpgcheck localinstall epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
  yum --enablerepo=epel install libffi
  yum --enablerepo=epel install xz-libs xz-devel xz

  wget http://yum.chrislea.com/centos/5/i386/chl-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
  yum --nogpgcheck localinstall chl-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
  yum --enablerepo=chl install python26 python26-devel

  wget http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.1-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
  yum --nogpgcheck localinstall rpmforge-release-0.5.1-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
  yum --enablerepo=rpmforge install cmake

  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML login
  # (just press enter when prompted for a password)
  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML co gccxml
  mkdir gccxml-build
  cd gccxml-build
  cmake ../gccxml
  make
  make test
  make install
  cd ..

  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pycryptopp/pycryptopp-0.5.17.tar.gz#md5=b3d19e7203531f8bd241ae58062f99e4
  tar -xf pycryptopp-0.5.17.tar.gz
  cd pycryptopp*
  python26 setup.py build
  python26 setup.py test
  python26 setup.py install
  cd ..

  wget http://apsw.googlecode.com/files/apsw-3.6.22-r1.zip
  unzip apsw-3.6.22-r1.zip
  cd apsw*
  python26 setup.py fetch --sqlite build
  python26 setup.py build
  python26 setup.py test
  python26 setup.py install
  cd ..

If you are using OpenVZ, you also need to execute the following in the
host::

  modprobe fuse
  vzctl set 101 --devices c:10:229:rw --save
  vzctl exec 101 mknod /dev/fuse c 10 229
  vzctl exec 101 reboot


Other distributions
-------------------

The following is a list of the programs and libraries required by
S3QL. Generally, you should first check if your distribution already
provides a suitable packages and only install from source if that is not the case.

The programs/libraries are required to run S3QL:

* The **Python development headers** should be available as a
  package in your distribution. The package is typically called
  something like `python-dev`, `python-devel` or `python2.6-devel`.
  To check if this package is installed, try to execute
  `python-config` (it should print out a brief help message).

* The **extended attribute headers** should be available as a
  package in your distribution. The package is typically called
  something like `libattr-dev`, `libattr1-dev`, `libattr-devel` or
  `libattr1-devel`. To see if this package is installed, check for a
  file called `xattr.h` in either `/usr/include/attr/` or
  `/usr/local/include/attr/`.

* The `FUSE Library <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/>`_ should
  already be installed on your system. But you should make sure that
  you also have the FUSE headers installed (the package is typically
  called something like `fuse-dev`, `libfuse-dev`, `fuse-devel` or
  `libfuse-devel`).

* The `PyCrypto++ Python Module <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycryptopp>`_
  may or may not be available as a package. To check if this module
  is already installed, try to execute `python -c 'import
  pycryptopp'`. If this succeeds (it should not print anything),
  you're all set. Otherwise you can install PyCrypto++ from source
  by downloading it from the website, extracting it into a temporary
  folder and running `python setup.py install --user`.

* The `GCC-XML compiler <http://www.gccxml.org>`_ compiler may or may
  not be available as a package. To check if GCC-XML is installed,
  try to run `gccxml --version` (it should print the version
  number). If GCC-XML is not installed, refer to the `GCC-XML
  installation instructions
  <http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Install.html>`_.

  nmpf.



Installing S3QL
===============

To install S3QL itself, proceed as follows:

1. Download S3QL from http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/downloads/list
2. Unpack it into a folder of your choice
3. Run `python setup.py build_ctypes` to generate a Python API for
   the installed FUSE library.
4. Run `python setup.py test` to run a self-test. If this fails, ask
   for help on the `mailing list
   <http://groups.google.com/group/s3ql>`_ or report a bug in the
   `issue tracker <http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/issues/list>`_.

No explicit installation is necessary, you can run all commands from
the `bin` directory.

If you want, you can also install S3QL system wide with `python
setup.py install` or into `~/.local` with `python setup.py install
--user`:command:. Note that if you install into `~/.local`, you should make
sure that `~/.local/bin` is in `$PATH`.
