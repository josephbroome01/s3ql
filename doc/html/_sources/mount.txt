==========
 Mounting
==========


A S3QL file system is mounted with the `mount.s3ql` command. It has the following syntax::
 mount.s3ql [options] <storage url> <mountpoint>

Note that S3QL is not a network file system like `NFS
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29>`_ or
`CIFS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFS>`_, so an S3QL file system
can only be mounted on one computer at a time.

`mount.s3ql` accepts the following options:

  --awskey=AWSKEY       Amazon Webservices access key to use. If not
                        specified, tries to read ~/.awssecret or the file
                        given by --credfile.
  --credfile=CREDFILE   Try to read AWS access key and key id from this file.
                        The file must be readable only be the owner and should
                        contain the key id and the secret key separated by a
                        newline. Default: ~/.awssecret
  --cachedir=CACHEDIR   Specifies the directory for cache files. Different
                        S3QL file systems (i.e. located in different S3
                        buckets) can share a cache location, even if they are
                        mounted at the same time. You should try to always use
                        the same location here, so that S3QL can detect and,
                        as far as possible, recover from unclean umounts.
                        Default is ~/.s3ql.
  --cachesize=CACHESIZE
                        Cache size in kb (default: 102400 (100 MB)). Should be
                        at least 10 times the blocksize of the filesystem,
                        otherwise an object may be retrieved and written
                        several times during a single write() or read()
                        operation.
  --logfile=LOGFILE     Write log messages in this file. Default:
                        ~/.s3ql/mount.log
  --debug=DEBUG         Activate debugging output from specified module. Use
                        'all' to get debug messages from all modules. This
                        option can be specified multiple times.
  --quiet               Be really quiet
  --allow-other         Allow other users to access the filesystem as well and
                        enforce unix permissions. (if neither this option nor
                        --allow-other is specified, only the mounting user can
                        access the file system, and has full access to every
                        file, independent of individual permissions.
  --allow-root          Allow root to access the filesystem as well and
                        enforce unix permissions. (if neither this option nor
                        --allow-other is specified, only the mounting user can
                        access the file system, and has full access to every
                        file, independent of individual permissions.
  --fg                  Do not daemonize, stay in foreground
  --single              Run in single threaded mode. If you don't understand
                        this, then you don't need it.
  --atime               Update directory access time. Will decrease
                        performance.
