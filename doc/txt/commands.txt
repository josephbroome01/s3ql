 Other S3QL Commands
=====================

Getting file system statistics
==============================

You can get more information about a mounted S3QL file system with the
`stat.s3ql` command. It has the following syntax::

  stat.s3ql <mountpoint>


Probably the most interesting numbers are the total size of your data,
the total size after duplication, and the final size after
de-duplication and compression.

`stat.s3ql` also has some additional options. Run `stat.s3ql --help`
for a complete list.

Changing the Passphrase
=======================

To change the passphrase a bucket, use the `tune.s3ql` command::

  tune.s3ql --change-passphrase  <storage url>

The passphrase can only be changed when the bucket is not mounted.

Checking for Errors
===================

If, for some reason, the filesystem has not been correctly unmounted,
or if you suspect that there might be errors, you should run the
`fsck.s3ql` utility. It has the following syntax::

 fsck.s3ql [options] <storage url>

To get a list of all available options, run `fsck.s3ql --help`.

Upgrading the file system
=========================

If you have installed a new version of S3QL, is usually necessary to
upgrade your file system metdata. Note that afterwards the file system
can no longer be accessed with older versions of S3QL. To upgrade a
file system to the newest revision, execute ::

  tune.s3ql --upgrade <storage url>

You should make very sure that this command is not interrupted.

Deleting a file system
======================

A file system can be deleted with::

  tune.s3ql --delete <storage url>

This physically deletes all the data and file system structures.

Copying a file system
=====================

With ::

  tune.s3ql --copy <source storage url> <target storage url>

you can physically copy an entire filesystem. The two file systems
will be completely independent and take twice as much storage space.

You can use this command e.g. to relocate S3 buckets to a different
storage region.

For a complete list of `tune.s3ql` options and operations, run
`tune.s3ql --help`.
