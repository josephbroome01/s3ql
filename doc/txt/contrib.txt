Contributed Programs
=====================

S3QL comes with a few contributed programs that are not part of the
core distribution (and are therefore not installed automatically by
default), but which may nevertheless be useful. These programs are in
the `contrib` directory of the source distribution or in
`/usr/share/doc/s3ql/contrib` if you installed S3QL from a package.


benchmark.py
============

This program measures your uplink bandwidth and compression speed and
recommends a compression algorithm for optimal throughput.


s3_copy.py
==========

This program physically duplicates Amazon S3 bucket. It can be used to
migrate buckets to a different storage region or storage class
(standard or reduced redundancy).
