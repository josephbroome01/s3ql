Runtime Configuration
=====================


The `s3qlctrl` can be used to control a mounted S3QL file system. Its
syntax is ::

 s3qlctrl [options] <action> <mountpoint>

`<mountpoint>` must be the location of a mounted S3QL file system. 
For a list of valid options, run `s3qlctrl --help`. `<action>`
may be either of:

  :flushcache:
              Flush file system cache. The command blocks until the cache has
              been flushed.
  :stacktrace:  Dump stack trace for all active threads into logfile. This is for
              debugging purposes only.
