* S3QL is rather slow when an application tries to write data in
  unreasonably small chunks. If a 1 MB file is copied in chunks of 1
  KB, this will take more than 10 times as long as when it's copied
  with the (recommended) chunk size of 128 KB.

  This is a limitation of the FUSE library (which does not yet support
  write caching) which will hopefully be addressed in some future FUSE
  version.

  Most applications, including e.g. GNU `cp` and `rsync`, use
  reasonably large buffers and are therefore not affected by this
  problem and perform very efficient on S3QL file systems.

  However, if you encounter unexpectedly slow performance with a
  specific program, this might be due to the program using very small
  write buffers. Although this is not really a bug in the program,
  it might be worth to ask the program's authors for help.
