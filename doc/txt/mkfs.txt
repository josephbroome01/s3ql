====================
File System Creation
====================

A S3QL file system is created with the `mkfs.s3ql` command. It has the
following syntax::

  mkfs.s3ql [options] <storage url>

If you want to overwrite an existing bucket, you have to delete the
bucket with `tune.s3ql --delete` first.

You can specify the following options:

  --s3-location=S3_LOCATION
                        Specify storage location for new bucket.
                        Allowed values: `EU`, `us-west-1`, or
                        `us-standard`. The later is not recommended,
                        please refer to the FAQ for more information.
  --homedir=HOMEDIR     Directory for log files, cache and authentication
                        info. Default: `~/.s3ql`
  -L LABEL              Filesystem label
  --blocksize=BLOCKSIZE
                        Maximum size of s3 objects in KB (default: 10240)
  --plain               Create unencrypted file system
  --debug=DEBUG         Activate debugging output from specified module. Use
                        `all` to get debug messages from all modules. This
                        option can be specified multiple times.
  --quiet               Be really quiet


Unless you have specified the `--plain` option, `mkfs.s3ql` will ask you
to enter an encryption password. If you do not want to enter this
password every time that you mount the file system, you can store it
in the `~/.s3ql/authinfo` file, see :ref:`bucket_pw`.
