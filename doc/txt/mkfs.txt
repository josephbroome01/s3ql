====================
File System Creation
====================

A S3QL file system is created with the `mkfs.s3ql` command. It has the following syntax::

  mkfs.s3ql [options] <storage url>

If you want to overwrite an existing bucket, you have to delete the
bucket with `tune.s3ql --delete` first.

You can specify the following options:

  --awskey=AWSKEY       Amazon Webservices access key to use. If not
                        specified, tries to read ~/.awssecret or the file
                        given by --credfile.
  --logfile=LOGFILE     Write log messages in this file. Default:
                        ~/.s3ql/mkfs.log
  --s3-location=S3_LOCATION
                        Specify storage location for new bucket.
                        Allowed values: EU,us-west-1, or us-standard.
                        The later is not recommended.
  --credfile=CREDFILE   Try to read AWS access key and key id from this file.
                        The file must be readable only be the owner
                        and should contain the key id and the secret
                        key separated by a newline. Default:
                        ~/.awssecret
  --cachedir=CACHEDIR   Specifies the directory for cache files. Different
                        S3QL file systems (i.e. located in different
                        S3 buckets) can share a cache location, even
                        if they are mounted at the same time. You
                        should try to always use the same location
                        here, so that S3QL can detect and, as far as
                        possible, recover from unclean unmounts.
                        Default is ~/.s3ql.
  -L LABEL              Filesystem label
  --blocksize=BLOCKSIZE
                        Maximum size of s3 objects in KB (default: 10240)
  --encrypt             Create an AES encrypted filesystem
  --debug=DEBUG         Activate debugging output from specified module. Use
                        'all' to get debug messages from all modules. This
                        option can be specified multiple times.
  --quiet               Be really quiet
