====================
File System Creation
====================

A S3QL file system is created with the `mkfs.s3ql` command. It has the
following syntax::

  mkfs.s3ql [options] <storage url>

If you want to overwrite an existing bucket, you have to delete the
bucket with `tune.s3ql --delete` first.

You can specify the following options:

  --s3-location=S3_LOCATION
                        Specify storage location for new bucket.
                        Allowed values: `EU`, `us-west-1`, or
                        `us-standard`. The later is not recommended,
                        please refer to the FAQ for more information.
  --homedir=HOMEDIR     Directory for log files, cache and authentication
                        info.Default: `~/.s3ql`

  --blocksize=BLOCKSIZE
                        Maximum size of s3 objects in KB (default: 10240)
  --encrypt             Create an encrypted and compressed file system
  --debug=DEBUG         Activate debugging output from specified module. Use
                        `all` to get debug messages from all modules. This
                        option can be specified multiple times.
