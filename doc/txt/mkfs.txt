====================
File System Creation
====================

A S3QL file system is created with the `mkfs.s3ql` command. It has the
following syntax::

  mkfs.s3ql [options] <storage url>

If you want to overwrite an existing bucket, you have to delete the
bucket with `s3qladm --delete` first.

The most important options are:

  --s3-location=<name>  Specify storage location for new bucket. Allowed
                        values: `EU`, `us-west-1`, `ap-southeast-1`,
                        or `us-standard`. The later is not
                        recommended, please refer to the FAQ at
                        http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/ for more
                        information.
  -L <name>             Filesystem label
  --blocksize=<size>    Maximum block size in KB (default: 10240)
  --plain               Create unencrypted file system.

For a full list of available options, run `mkfs.s3ql --help`.

Unless you have specified the `--plain` option, `mkfs.s3ql` will ask you
to enter an encryption password. If you do not want to enter this
password every time that you mount the file system, you can store it
in the `~/.s3ql/authinfo` file, see :ref:`bucket_pw`.
