==========
 Mounting
==========


A S3QL file system is mounted with the `mount.s3ql` command. It has
the following syntax::

  mount.s3ql [options] <storage url> <mountpoint>

Note that S3QL is not a network file system like `NFS
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29>`_ or
`CIFS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFS>`_, so an S3QL file system
can only be mounted on one computer at a time.

You can specify the following options:

  --homedir=HOMEDIR     Directory for log files, cache and authentication
                        info. Default: `~/.s3ql`
  --cachesize=CACHESIZE
                        Cache size in kb (default: 102400 (100 MB)). Should be
                        at least 10 times the blocksize of the filesystem,
                        otherwise an object may be retrieved and written
                        several times during a single write() or read()
                        operation.
  --debug=DEBUG         Activate debugging output from specified module. Use
                        `all` to get debug messages from all modules. This
                        option can be specified multiple times.
  --quiet               Be really quiet
  --allow-other         Normally, only the user who called `mount.s3ql` can access
                        the mount point. This user then also has full
                        access to it, independent of individual file
                        permissions. If the `--allow-other` option is
                        specified, other users can access the mount
                        point as well and individual file permissions
                        are taken into account for all users.
  --allow-root          Like `--allow_other`, but also allow the root user
                        to access the mount point.
  --fg                  Do not daemonize, stay in foreground
  --single              Run in single threaded mode. If you don't understand
                        this, then you don't need it.
  --profile             Create profiling information. If you don't understand
                        this, then you don't need it.


Notes about Caching
===================

S3QL maintains a local cache of the file system data to speed up
access. The cache is block based, so it is possible that only parts of
a file are in the cache.

Maximum Number of Cache Entries
-------------------------------

The maximum size of the cache can be configured with the `--cachesize`
option when the file system is mounted. However, there is also a
second limitation: the maximum number of objects in the cache is
limited to 768. It is therefore possible that the cache may actually
never grow up to the maximum cache size, because the maximum number of
cache elements has been reached. The reason for this limit is that, by
default, Linux limits the number of open files per process to about
one thousand and S3QL requires an open file for each cache entry.

If you are bothered by this limitation, you have to configure your
system to increase the maximum number of open file handles and then
edit the `MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES` line in `src/s3ql/block_cache.py`. At
some point, this may become a command line option as well (see `issue
112 <http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/issues/detail?id=112>`_).

Cache Flushing and Expiration
-----------------------------

S3QL flushes changed blocks in the cache to the backend whenever a block
has not been accessed for at least 10 seconds. Note that when a block is
flushed, it still remains in the cache.

Cache expiration (i.e., removal of blocks from the cache) is only done
when the maximum cache size is reached. S3QL always expires the least
recently used blocks first.

Mounting in `/etc/fstab`
========================

It is also possible to mount an S3QL file system automatically in
`/etc/fstab`. For that, S3QL has to be installed system-wide (see
:ref:`inst-s3ql`) and you have to place a copy of the `mount.s3ql`
command in the `/sbin` directory.

A sample entry for S3QL in `/etc/fstab` would look like
this::

  s3://my_s3ql_bucket     /mnt/s3     s3ql    homedir=/var/s3ql,allow-other,allow_root  0  0

Note that most likely you will have to specify the `homedir` option
when mounting from fstab because the `$HOME` environment variable is
not set in this case (and `mount.s3ql` cannot figure out a sensible
default for `--homedir` without it).

Note also that you should make sure that the file system is unmounted
every once in a while. S3QL flushes the file system metadata only when
the file system is unmounted, so if you had an S3QL file system
mounted for several days and then your harddisk crashes (so that
`fsck.s3ql` cannot recover the local metadata), you will loose all the
changes that you have made since the last successful unmount. Your
data will still be stored on the backend, but without the metadata it
will not be linked to any directory entries.
