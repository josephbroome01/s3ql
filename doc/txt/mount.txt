==========
 Mounting
==========


A S3QL file system is mounted with the `mount.s3ql` command. It has
the following syntax::

  mount.s3ql [options] <storage url> <mountpoint>

Note that S3QL is not a network file system like `NFS
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29>`_ or
`CIFS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFS>`_, so an S3QL file system
can only be mounted on one computer at a time.

You can specify the following options:

  --homedir=HOMEDIR     Directory for log files, cache and authentication
                        info. Default: `~/.s3ql`
  --cachesize=CACHESIZE
                        Cache size in kb (default: 102400 (100 MB)). Should be
                        at least 10 times the blocksize of the filesystem,
                        otherwise an object may be retrieved and written
                        several times during a single write() or read()
                        operation.
  --debug=DEBUG         Activate debugging output from specified module. Use
                        `all` to get debug messages from all modules. This
                        option can be specified multiple times.
  --quiet               Be really quiet
  --allow-other         Normally, only the user who called `mount.s3ql` can access
                        the mount point. This user then also has full
                        access to it, independent of individual file
                        permissions. If the `--allow-other` option is
                        specified, other users can access the mount
                        point as well and individual file permissions
                        are taken into account for all users.
  --allow-root          Like `--allow_other`, but also allow the root user
                        to access the mount point.
  --fg                  Do not daemonize, stay in foreground
  --single              Run in single threaded mode. If you don't understand
                        this, then you don't need it.
  --profile             Create profiling information. If you don't understand
                        this, then you don't need it.
