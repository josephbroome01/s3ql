Getting Statistics
==================

You can get more information about a mounted S3QL file system with the
`s3qlstat` command. It has the following syntax::

  s3qlstat [options] <mountpoint>

Probably the most interesting numbers are the total size of your data,
the total size after duplication, and the final size after
de-duplication and compression.

`s3qlstat` can only be called by the user that mounted the file system
and (if the file system was mounted with `--allow-other` or `--allow-root`)
the root user. This limitation might be removed in the future (see `issue 155
<http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/issues/detail?id=155>`_).

For a full list of available options, run `s3qlstat --help`.
