    A RetryIterator instance iterates over the elements produced by any
    generator function passed to its constructor, i.e. it wraps the iterator
    obtained by calling the generator function.  When retrieving elements from the
    wrapped iterator, exceptions may occur. Most such exceptions are
    propagated. However, exceptions for which the *is_temp_failure_fn* function
    returns True are caught. If that happens, the wrapped iterator is replaced
    by a new one obtained by calling the generator function again with the
    *start_after* parameter set to the last element that was retrieved before
    the exception occured.

    If attempts to retrieve the next element fail repeatedly, the iterator is
    replaced only after sleeping for increasing intervals. If no new element can
    be obtained after `RETRY_TIMEOUT` seconds, the last exception is no longer
    caught but propagated to the caller. This behavior is implemented by
    wrapping the __next__ method with the `retry` decorator.
