    """Manages access to file blocks
    
    Operations on blocks need to be synchronized between different threads,
    since otherwise we may
    
    * write into an object that is currently being expired and 
      uploaded and loose the changes
    
    * retrieve the same object twice, where data from the retrieval
      that runs longer overwrites data written after the end of the
      first retrieval.
      
    * read or write at the wrong position, if a different thread has
      moved the file cursor.
 
    For this reason, all operations on blocks are mediated by
    a BlockCache object. Whenever the file system needs to write or read
    from an block, it uses the `BlockCache.get()` context manager 
    which provides a file handle to the block. The block cache retrieves
    and stores blocks on the backend as necessary. Moreover, it provides
    methods to delete and create blocks, once again taking care
    of the necessary locking.

    
    Locking Procedure
    -----------------
    
    Threads may block when acquiring a Python lock and when trying to
    access the database. To prevent deadlocks, a function must not
    try to acquire any Python lock when it holds a database lock (i.e.,
    is in the middle of a transaction). This has also to be taken
    into account when calling other functions, especially from e.g.
    BlockCache.
