    """Manage access to database cursors.
    
    This class manages access to database cursors. Its main objective
    is to ensure that every thread works with a thread-local connection. 
    This allows SQLite to take care of the necessary locking (so we 
    automatically get a distinction between read- and write-locks) and 
    also ensures 
    that one can uniquely retrieve the last inserted rowid and the
    number of rows affected by the last statement.
    
    Instances can be used as if they were cursors itself. In addition
    to the standard `execute` method, they provide convenience methods
    like `get_val', `get_row` or `changes`. Note that all these 
    calls allocate a new cursor in order to avoid aborting 
    a result set from a previous call.
    
    Note that threading.local() does not work when the threads are
    not started by threading.Thread() but some C library (like fuse).
    For that reason we use a hash on the thread ID instead. The
    thread id is not globally unique to a thread, but only unique
    among other currently running threads. This is not a problem
    because we can freely pass around Connections between threads,
    we just want to make sure that a connection is only used by
    one thread at a time.
    
    TODO: It seems that _threading_local.local() does work. Maybe 
    we should use that instead? cf. http://bugs.python.org/issue6627
