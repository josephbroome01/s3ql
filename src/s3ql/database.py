This module manages access to the SQLite database. Its main objective
is to ensure that every thread works with a thread-local connection. 
This allows to rely on SQLite to take care of locking procedures
and ensures that one can uniquely retrieve the last inserted rowid and the
number of rows affected by the last statement.

Note that threading.local() does not work when the threads are
not started by threading.Thread() but some C library (like fuse).
The python implementation in _threading_local does work, but
it is not clear if and when local objects are being destroyed.
Therefore we maintain a pool of connections that are
shared between all threads.

Public functions (not starting with an underscore) of this module
are threadsafe and safe to call concurrently from several threads.

Module Attributes:
-----------

:retrytime:    In case the database is locked by another thread,
               we wait for the lock to be released for at most
               `retrytime` milliseconds.
:pool:         List of available cursors (one for each database connection)
:provided:     Dict of currently provided ConnectionWrapper instances
:dbfile:       Filename of the database
:initsql:      SQL commands that are executed whenever a new
               connection is created.

    This class wraps an APSW connection object. It should be used instead of any
    native APSW cursors.
    
    It provides methods to directly execute SQL commands and creates apsw
    cursors dynamically.
    
    Instances are not thread safe. They can be passed between threads,
    but must not be called concurrently.
    
    Instances also takes care of converting bytes objects into buffer
    objects and back, so that they are stored as BLOBS in the database. If you
    want to store TEXT, you need to supply unicode objects instead. (This
    functionality is only needed under Python 2.x, under Python 3.x the apsw
    module already behaves in the correct way).
