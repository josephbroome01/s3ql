    This class manages access to the SQLite database. Its main objective
    is to ensure that every thread works with a thread-local connection. 
    This allows to rely on SQLite to take care of locking procedures
    and ensures that one can uniquely retrieve the last inserted rowid and the
    number of rows affected by the last statement.

    Note that threading.local() does not work when the threads are
    not started by threading.Thread() but some C library (like fuse).
    The python implementation in _threading_local does work, but
    it is not clear if and when local objects are being destroyed.
    Therefore we maintain a pool of connections that are
    shared between all threads.
