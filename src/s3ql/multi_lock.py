    """Provides locking for multiple objects.
    
    This class provides locking for a dynamically changing set of objects:
    The `acquire` and `release` methods have an additional argument, the
    locking key. Only locks with the same key can actually see each other,
    so that several threads can hold locks with different locking keys
    at the same time.
    
    MultiLock instances can be used with `with` statements as
    
    lock = MultiLock()
    with lock(key):
        pass
        
    Note that it is actually possible for one thread to release a lock
    that has been obtained by a different thread. This is not a bug,
    but a feature used in  `BlockCache._expire_parallel`.
