class S3Cache(object):
    """Manages access to s3 objects
    
    Operations on s3 objects need to be synchronized between different threads,
    since otherwise we may
    
    * write into an object that is currently being expired and 
      uploaded and loose the changes
    
    * retrieve the same object twice, where data from the retrieval
      that runs longer overwrites data written after the end of the
      first retrieval.
      
    * read or write at the wrong position, if a different thread has
      moved the file cursor.
 
    For this reason, all operations on s3 files are mediated by
    an S3Cache object. Whenever the file system needs to write or read
    from an s3 object, it uses a context manager provided by the S3Cache
    object which returns a file handle to the s3 object. The S3Cache retrieves
    and stores objects on S3 as necessary. Moreover, it provides
    methods to delete and create s3 objects, once again taking care
    of the necessary locking.

    
    Locking Procedure
    -----------------
    
    Whenever locking is required, first a global lock is acquired. Under
    the global lock, the required s3 key is looked up (or created) in the
    sqlite database. With the s3 key known, a key-specific lock is
    acquired and then the global lock released. 
    
    
    Attributes:
    -----------
    
    Note: None of the attributes may be accessed from outside the class,
    since only the instance methods can provide the required synchronization. 

    :keys:        OrderedDict of keys that are currently in cache
    :bucket:      Bucket object to access AWS
    :maxsize:     Maximum size to which the cache can grow
    :size:        Current size of the cache
    :cachedir:    Where to put the cache files
    :s3_lock:     MultiLock to synchronize access to individual s3 objects
    :global_lock: Global lock    
    :timeout:     Maximum time to wait for changes in S3 to propagate
    :dbcm:        ConnectionManager instance, to manage access to the database
                  from different threads
    :bgcommit:    Enable background commit mode
    :commit_thread: Background committer thread
    :shutdown:    Flag for committer thread to shut down
                  
    
    The `expect_mismatch` attribute is only for unit testing instrumentation
    and suppresses warnings if a mismatch between local and remote etag
    is encountered.                   
    
    Background Commit Mode
    ----------------------
    
    In background commit mode, expire(), close() and flush() do not actually 
    commit any data to S3. Instead, __init__() starts a background thread that
    periodically performs cache expiration. This means that the cache can grow without
    bounds and uncommitted changes may reside in the cache even after
    the file system has been unmounted. 
    
    
    Cache Management
    ----------------
    
    Note that every s3 object in the cache occupies a file
    descriptor. The maximum number of objects in the cache is
    therefore hardcoded to 300 (so that we do not run out of
    file descriptors). If the block size of the filesystem is
    small, and the cache size is large, it can therefore happen
    that the cache is expired before it reaches maximum size.
    
    Note that this maximum is enforced even in background commit
    mode, i.e. if 300 objects are in cache, a writer to a new
    object has to wait until one of the objects has been
    expired and committed to S3.
