    Implementation Note:
    --------------------
            
    ThreadGroup instances have an internal lock object that is used to
    communicate with the started threads. These threads do not hold the global
    lock when they start and finish. To prevent deadlocks, the instance-level
    lock must therefore only be acquired when the global lock is not held.
