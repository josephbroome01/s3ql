This module defines a new TestCase that aborts the test run as 
soon as a test fails. The module also servers as a storage container
for authentication data that may be required for some test cases.


Test case policy
----------------

Each test should correspond to exactly one function in the tested module. The
test should assume that any other functions that are called by the tested
function work perfectly. However, the test must not rely on the result of any
other functions when checking the correctness of the tested function.

Example: if a module has methods `write_file_to_disk`, `write_some_bytes` and
`read_file_from_disk`, then the test for `write_file_to_disk` may assume that
the `write_some_bytes` method that is called by `write_file_to_disk` works
correctly, but it must not use the `read_file_from_disk` method to check if the
file has been written correctly.
